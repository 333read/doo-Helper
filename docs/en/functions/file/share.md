# File Sharing

The file sharing function enables users to flexibly manage the sharing scope and permissions of files and folders, ensuring smooth information flow while effectively protecting file security.

## File and Folder Sharing Features

- **Sharing Scope**: Users can flexibly set the sharing scope of files or folders according to their needs, choosing between sharing with specific members or public sharing. Different sharing scopes allow for more granular file access control, helping effective management based on specific situations.
  
- **Permission Settings**: When sharing files or folders, users can set "read-only" or "editable" permissions to ensure file content security. Choosing "read-only" permission prevents accidental modifications, while "editable" permission allows team members to make necessary modifications and updates.

- **Share Management**: Users can view and manage their shared files and folders at any time, and adjust permission settings or cancel sharing when needed. Administrators can easily manage the status of all shared files to ensure smooth team collaboration.

- **Upload File Viewing**: For unshared folders, users can still view their own uploaded files but cannot access content uploaded by other members, thus protecting personal privacy and data security.
