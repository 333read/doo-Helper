# File Display

To enhance user experience, we provide flexible display modes, including icon view and list view, helping users quickly browse and manage files.

## Icon View Mode
- **Intuitive and Clean**: Files are displayed in icon form, providing a clean and clear visual effect that allows users to quickly identify different types of files. Each file is represented by a unique icon, avoiding cluttered text information.
- **Enhanced Browsing Experience**: Ideal for quick file browsing, especially when there are multiple file types. Icon view mode helps users distinguish file categories more intuitively through icons, improving operational efficiency.
