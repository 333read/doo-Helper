# Anonymous Messages

Anonymous messaging is a feature in the instant messaging module that allows users to send messages through a bot while hiding their identity during chats. Recipients will not be able to know the true source of the message.

## Feature Description

- **Initiating Anonymous Messages**  
  When having a one-on-one chat with others, click the âŠ• button next to the input box and select "Anonymous Message" to enter the message content you want to send anonymously, without displaying sender information.

- **Use Cases**  
  - Sending sensitive content while wanting to keep identity private
  - Providing suggestions or feedback without direct contact
  - Creating a more private communication environment

## How to Use

1. **Enter Chat Interface and Select Anonymous Mode**  
   Open the instant messaging module, start a chat with the target user, and select "Anonymous Mode" in the message input box.

## Important Notes

- **Anonymous Limitations**:  
  - Anonymous messages are only available for one-on-one chats, not supported in group chats.
  - Misuse of the anonymous feature (such as harassment or sending illegal content) may result in feature restrictions or account suspension.

- **Feedback and Records**:  
  While recipients won't know the message source, the platform records messaging behavior to prevent abuse.
