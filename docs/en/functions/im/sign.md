## Feature Characteristics

- **Status Synchronization**: Regardless of which device you use to change conversation status (unread, read, or pinned), the status will automatically sync across all of your devices. This ensures users see consistent message states across different devices.

- **Notification Updates**: When marking a conversation as unread, the system will update notifications in the notification bar according to user settings, reminding users of pending messages.

## Use Cases

- **Task Management**: Users can mark conversations that need follow-up as unread for later review.
- **Information Filtering**: By marking conversations as read, users can quickly clear processed messages and reduce information overload.
- **Quick Access**: Through the pinning feature, users can fix important conversations at the top of the list for quick access and handling of key dialogues.

The above explains how to manage conversation read status and pinning features in instant messaging applications. These features are designed to help users organize and process information more efficiently. Based on user feedback and requirements, these features can be further optimized and expanded.
