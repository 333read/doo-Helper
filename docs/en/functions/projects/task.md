# Task Management

Task creation and management are crucial elements in efficient collaboration and team goal management. We will detail how to create tasks through **DooTask** and manage task settings including priority, time, collaborators, visibility, subtasks, attachments, and more.


## Task Creation Methods

In **DooTask**, there are two ways to create tasks, meeting different scenario needs:

### Quick Creation

**Operation Process**:

- **Important but Not Urgent** (3 days)
- **Urgent but Not Important** (5 days)
